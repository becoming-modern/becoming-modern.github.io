  <div class="split-bio">
  <p>Something big happened, in the Nineteenth Century. Or maybe more than one big thing.  Perhaps a whole system of subtly interrelated transformations that changed the world permanently and irrevocably. Europeans overrunning the world. A massive increase in the power and size of the state. An avalanche of statistics. A fundamental shift in the nature of daily experience. The exponential growth of science.  The industrialization of almost all economic production. The first glimmerings of anthropogenic climate change. This course examines all these topics and more through a focus on cultural history &ndash; the ways that Europeans, Americans, and colonized peoples came to understand and grapple with the massive changes they saw around them. We especially focus on the category of &ldquo;modernity&rdquo;, which took on tremendous significance in industry, science, art, literature and politics. What did people think it meant to be &ldquo;modern&rdquo;, from the late Eighteenth Century to the early Twentieth? And how should we answer that question today?</p>

<p>Coming to U of T History Department in Winter, 2019. Stay tuned for more.</p>
